Path Finding Algorithm Solver Documentation
================================================================================

About
___________

Within this project, we hope to be able to build a software package that enables
users to explore the tradeoffs of utilizing different path-planning algorithms
with different vehicles in both static and dynamic environments. Currently we will
be utilizing A*, Djikstra's, and RRTs as each of these algorithms have their own
pros and cons. 


Overview of Our System's Functionality
________________________________________________________________________________

The system will include the following options: 

* Type of Path-Finding Algorithm
* Type of Obstacles 
* Dynamic/Static Obstacles 
* Type of Vehicle (UAV or Car)
